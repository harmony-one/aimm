I love the hard problems that lie at the heart of complex systems.Running my own business has given me a unique perspective as a developer which I can draw on while problem solving day to day. I’m great at iterating on products with clients until they meet both their stated and unstated desires.I have a real algorithms bent so if you want something fancy or complex I can code it up for you. I'm happy to tear code up and refactor, or can track down that tricky bug and crush it. Regularly called on to pick the right technology, I make critical and pragmatic decisions, rapidly becoming productive with whatever is necessary to get the job done"

I've probably spent the most time with Linux, C++, and ML biz (Mostly Keras and Pytorch), but I've never had trouble picking up new stuff; like most living engineers, I've written a ton of python and javascript incidentally; like many who have gotten into the weeds of their stack, I've hacked in some C and CUDA occasionally; like many who've hung around a computer science department, I've played with haskell and scala; like I hope many here do, I've tried out funny or promising little languages that show up on HN from time to time. I ""know"" zero programming languages, but I have used many, and generally find that understanding the problem and knowing how to learn quickly is more useful than expertise in specific tools"|Available on request||"advael 75 days ago | prev | next [–]Sure"

Let’s chat!|robby.ronk@gmail.com|"robbs 4 months ago | prev | next [–]I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer with 13+ years of experience.I love to learn and share what I know! As a full stack Python developer at a cinema VFX company, I brought React to my team and set them up with a toolkit that enable them to build apps 4x faster. I ran workshops, mentored 1:1 and developed best practices to clarify to my team how to build with Python and React. At a national Internet company, I solved browser breaking artifacts on the national Broadband Map using Python and PostGIS. At a Solar SaaS, I used Python to abstract bespoke Solar Lender APIs so that the Sales Platform could onboard new lenders with minimal changes, ultimately leading to gigawatts of panels on roofs and billions of dollars of deals done. Recently, I've maintained a legacy Django platform while executing a migration into a new platform.I'm proud that my Python and React has helped create movies with box offices in the billions, helped an entire country find broadband and installed gigawatts of clean energy. I'm excited to leverage my Python and React skills to contribute to your team's success."

I'm a quick learner and love picking up new tech, so as long as you're ok with giving me some gentle guidance on idioms and libraries I'm confident I can pick up whatever tech stack you need me to work on. I'm naturally very curious, and if you're working in an interesting industry with a great product that doesn't exploit its users, I'm eager to build something great with you. Above all, I'm looking for a company that has a strong purpose and values that match my own.A note on remote: this is a hard requirement for me. The only exception might be a 'synchronized hybrid' where everyone is in the office on the same day(s), but that seems rare and you'd also need an office in Vancouver."

From 2018 to 2022, I was a software engineer at Amazon, with 2 internships and followed by a full time position. During that time, I have led projects in developing Android apps, React/Angular websites, and backend systems built on AWS. In late 2021, I decided to begin the process of taking a career break to spend time and provide care for a close family member diagnosed with cancer. By early 2022, I had parted ways with Amazon, and began taking on part time freelance projects focusing on web development. I am now looking to join a great team and great people where I can simultaneously grow as an engineer and quickly provide value to a shared goal.You can read a little more about me on my website at https://tylerhoward.dev.

I fell in love with programming 9 years ago, and have been aiming to make maintainable, user-friendly software ever since. Outside of school, I've built my programming skills by creating a number of side projects, working freelance, and doing two summer-long full-time internships at Domino's. At the University of Michigan, I've taken courses covering machine learning, robotics, computer microarchitecture, data structures & algorithms, technical communication, and more."

Six years of leadership in teams of up to 7 people.Looking for an engineering manager or senior IC position to mentor your team and make something people want.Here are a sample of things I've accomplished:* I built a platform for hosting web applications using Kubernetes at a major cloud provider and taught engineers to operate and improve it. It uses Helm to manage the instances of the single-tenant app and includes a Python application to manage the customer instances based on configuration from the subscription management vendor.* I trained and mentored a team of developers in software patterns, communication, and prioritizing work, and I reduced context switching in the team’s workflows, leading to a 72% increase in velocity in two months.* I maintain for the community Apt package for Helm, the Kubernetes package manager, which is downloaded more than 200,000 times per month.* I developed a CI/CD pipeline to build Docker images for a web app, run automated tests, and update the customer applications after every merge.* I improved performance of a proprietary VPN by adopting Cython, permitting use of C functions in Python, resulting in a 2.5x increase in network throughput when limited by CPU"

I had two main responsibilities I needed to balance: people management (upwards with product stakeholders, laterally with other pods and work streams, and downwards with my team) and doing some heavy lifting as an individual contributor. I created structure and improved hygiene in the team, codebase, and sprint/scrum life cycle, which stabilized our velocity and allowed us to find our rhythm and deliver on schedule.Unfortunately, my current role has been transforming more and more into a business/digital consultant, which means a lot of working on slide decks and high-level architectures that never see the light of day.
